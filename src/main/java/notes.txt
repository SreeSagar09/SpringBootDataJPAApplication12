A Program to show how to save, update and delete records by using @Query annotation:
Programs:
* SpringBootDataJPAApplication12Application.java
* ProductController.java
* Product.java
* ProductRepository.java
* ProductService.java
* ProductServiceImpl.java
Notes:
* If we insert record by using @Query annotation the query must be native query.
* To perform save, update and delete related methods should be annotated by @Modifying, @Transactional
* If we not annotated @Modifying at method level it will throw org.hibernate.hql.internal.QueryExecutionRequestException exception.
* And if we not annotated @Transactional at method or class level it will throw javax.persistence.TransactionRequiredException exception.
Output:
From main method in SpringBootDataJPAApplication12Application class.
